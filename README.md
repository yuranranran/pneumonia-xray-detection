# Pneumonia X-ray Classification

This project uses deep learning (CNN) to classify chest X-ray images into NORMAL and PNEUMONIA.

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Chest X-ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)
- Pre-split into `train/`, `test/`, and `val/` folders

## 📊 Models
- Baseline CNN (3 conv layers)
- CNN with Image Augmentation
- Transfer Learning: EfficientNetB0

## 📈 Results
- Highest validation accuracy: ~87.5%
- Used Matplotlib/Seaborn for visual EDA & metrics plotting
